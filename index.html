The dataset contained data on direct marketing campaigns carried out by a Portuguese banking institution, including information about the campaign, the client, and the outcomes of the marketing effort. With 20 attributes and over 41,000 records, I aimed to answer three key questions: (1) Analyzing contact methods for lead conversion to subscribers, (2) Analyzing customer demographics and their relation to campaign success, and (3) Analyzing the relationship between contact type and success. To answer these questions, I used SQL to clean and preprocess the data, and then performed various queries and visualizations to analyze the results. The findings from this analysis could help banking institutions make more informed decisions on their marketing campaigns and strategies. The project was a valuable learning experience in data analysis, providing me with a deeper understanding of the potential insights that can be gained from data-driven decision-making.</a> </p>

									<p><a href="https://github.com/Data820/PortfolioProjects-/blob/main/Python%20Bike%20Data%20Project.pdf" target= "_blank">In this project, I used Python libraries such as Pandas and Seaborn to analyze and visualize data from a bike sharing dataset from Washington D.C. The dataset included information on the number of bike rentals, weather conditions, and seasonal information from the years 2011 and 2012. By cleaning and manipulating the data, I was able to study the impact of various weather conditions on bike rental usage in the city. Through a thorough analysis, I was able to uncover insights and trends in the data and present my findings in an easy-to-understand and visually appealing way. This project provided a great opportunity for me to apply my data science skills and gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between weather and bike rentals. </a></p>

The goal of this project was to explore and analyze the data to identify trends and patterns in order to make recommendations to stakeholders, including policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and insurance companies. I began by cleaning and preparing the dataset, dropping irrelevant columns and rows with missing values. I then conducted exploratory data analysis and discovered that Brooklyn had the highest number of collisions, with the most common contributing factor being driver inattention/distraction. Based on these findings, I made recommendations to stakeholders to implement targeted interventions and increase awareness campaigns to reduce the number of collisions and fatalities on the roads. Additionally, I provided insurance companies with recommendations on how to improve their risk assessment and pricing models based on the insights gained from the analysis.</a></p>

I analyzed a dataset containing factors such as age, body mass index (BMI), number of children, and other variables. I employed two different algorithms, Linear Regression and Random Forest, to create predictive models and compared their accuracy in estimating healthcare costs. After training both models, I fine-tuned the Random Forest model to achieve better performance. The results showed that the Random Forest model outperformed the Linear Regression model, providing more accurate predictions. This project demonstrated the potential of machine learning algorithms in predicting healthcare costs and assisting stakeholders in making well-informed decisions regarding insurance charges.</a></p>

										As a data enthusiast with a keen interest in higher education, I decided to embark on a project that would provide a comprehensive overview of the educational landscape at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), one of the world's leading institutions.
